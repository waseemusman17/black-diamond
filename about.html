                        <p>We here at Black Diamond Beef have set out to provide our customers with the highest quality, sustainable, farm fresh meats. Through our products, we invite customers into our mission to put honesty and integrity back into the food at our dinner table. We place value on the earth and the economy in equal measure, as part of our promise to bring you access to only the most humane, transparent, and responsible livestock raising systems. They represent the heart and soul of our family ranch – a guiding compass that has helped us preserve our traditions across multiple generations. To our valued customers, our goal is to always be much more than just a consumer meat company. Whether online, or in-person, you can rely on Black Diamond Beef to be your personal liaison – between quality ranchers, family farms, and cooperatives.</p>

                        <p>Every product is personally delivered from farm to doorstep, by one of our staff. Remember that you have a choice about what you’re feeding your family. We will never mislead you about our meat and encourage you to check out our resources about the benefits of grass fed grass finished beef.  </p>

                        <p>We source only 100% U.S. beef direct from farming cooperatives with zero reliance on medicine, chemicals, or other growth hormones. Unlike high-volume livestock operations, we form only true partnerships held securely in place by values and a shared commitment – to never produce poor-quality, nutrient deficient food. All of our partnering ranches care about the nourishment, health, and well-being of their herds. Like our customers, our animals are accommodated and cared for. Careful steps are taken to ensure a healthy, ethical, and sustainable process that starts right on the ranch. No chemicals or additives means we give you the true benefits of grass-fed, grass-finished beef. Every USDA-inspected product is crafted with the promise that you and your family can buy and enjoy with confidence. Guaranteed.</p>

                        <p>STRAIGHT FROM THE FARM – our goal is to connect you with locally sourced, all natural farmers market meats. In order to achieve this, our partners at Jones Meats (Rigby, ID) ensure that we’re able to process and transport healthier chicken & pork products to countless happy customers here in Las Vegas. Look no further for wholesome, USDA-certified, federally-inspected products – let us do the honor of restoring confidence, security, and safety back into the processes by which meat is brought to you, the consumer. Unlike the larger facilities who receive mass shipments from all over the country and (more commonly, now) abroad, we’re going the extra mile to bring local, sustainable practices to our Vegas community.</p>
